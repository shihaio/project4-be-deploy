**Challenges**
Study material is insufficient. I looked for more learning resources of Django REST Framework from various resources like StackOverflow, Django Documentation, Youtube.
We need to perform a few steps to transform data between frontend and backend. Python uses dict, Django uses models and React uses JSON.
Creating a custom new user account rather than using Django own administrator page.
